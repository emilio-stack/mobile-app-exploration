# Overview

In this repository is my exploration of the swift programming language. I have previously completed the same application in the kotlin language to run on Android devices. My aim is to explore and eventually master both Android and iOS mobile programming. 

This app is a simple math game that allows you to practice math with flashcards. You can set the operand you want to practice and the base number to practice. The app will generate a random number to create a problem and you will input it into the app and check if it is correct. The app will display a message accordingly and will show you the correct answer if you so desire.

My purpose is to focus on the syntax and language differences between kotlin and swift. I have previously completed this project in kotlin which allows me to purely focus on the swift programming langauge.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
